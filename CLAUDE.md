# ml-automation-timeseries

Time series analysis and forecasting. Prophet, ARIMA, neural forecasting, seasonality decomposition, temporal cross-validation, and anomaly detection. Requires spark-core installed.

This is one of 14 Claude Code plugins in the [Blend Spark Harness](https://github.com/BLEND360). Work is tracked in Jira project [PM3](https://blend360.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/PM3/board) — filter by label `plugin:timeseries`.

When invoked from CI/CD, you (Claude) act as an independent reviewer. You do not have the conversation context of whoever wrote the diff. Use this file plus `.claude/rules/` to ground your reasoning.

Treat the manifest, AGENTS.md, and the agents/commands/skills directories as the **plugin's public API**. Changes there are higher-risk than changes inside a single skill body.

## Routing — agents and skills in this plugin

### Available agents

| Agent | When to use |
|---|---|
| `timeseries-analyst` | User wants to explore time series data, check stationarity, decompose seasonality/trend, or understand temporal patterns |
| `forecaster` | User wants to build a forecast model using Prophet, ARIMA, or neural approaches, or run temporal cross-validation |
| `anomaly-detector` | User wants to detect anomalies or outliers in time series data |

### Available skills

| Skill | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `/ts-analyze` | "analyze this time series", "check stationarity", "explore temporal data", "time series EDA" |
| `/ts-forecast` | "forecast this series", "predict future values", "build a Prophet model", "ARIMA forecast" |
| `/ts-anomaly` | "detect anomalies", "find outliers in time series", "flag unusual spikes" |
| `/ts-decompose` | "decompose seasonality", "extract trend", "seasonal decomposition" |
| `/ts-evaluate` | "evaluate forecast accuracy", "MAPE, RMSE for my forecast", "backtest results" |
| `/ts-backtest` | "backtest the forecast", "walk-forward validation", "temporal cross-validation" |

(See `AGENTS.md` for the canonical routing table; this section is a reminder for CI-invoked Claude.)

## Severity criteria (review prompt)

When you produce a code review, classify each finding into one severity. **Report only** BUG / SECURITY / CORRECTNESS / BREAKING / CRITICAL. Skip the rest — they erode trust in the bot.

| Severity | When to flag | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | Production breakage, data loss, security exposure | Unguarded `eval`/`exec`, leaked secret, parallelism in benchmark harness |
| **BUG** | Code does not do what it claims | Off-by-one, wrong comparison operator, swallowed exception, comment contradicts code |
| **SECURITY** | Vulnerability or unsafe pattern | SQL/command injection, weak crypto, credentials in code |
| **CORRECTNESS** | Subtle incorrect behavior | Float `==`, mutable default arg, race condition, missing random seed |
| **BREAKING** | Public-API contract change | Removed agent, renamed command, plugin manifest schema change without migration |

**Do NOT flag** (skip silently): style/lint, missing docstrings on private functions, subjective preferences, "consider adding tests" without a specific case, micro-optimizations.

## Few-shot examples for ambiguous cases

**`try/except: pass` is sometimes the right answer.**

```python
# CORRECT — best-effort cache cleanup
try:
    cache.cleanup_expired()
except Exception:
    pass  # cleanup failure must not block the request
```
→ Do not flag. Comment makes intent clear.

```python
# WRONG — swallows errors that should bubble
try:
    response = api.call(payload); process(response)
except Exception:
    pass  # ???
```
→ Flag as BUG.

**Mutable default argument.** `def f(xs=[])` → flag CORRECTNESS. `def f(xs=None)` with `if xs is None: xs = []` → fine.

**Float equality.** `if score == 0.95` → flag CORRECTNESS, use `math.isclose`.

## Test fixtures and conventions

- Tests live in `tests/` (or alongside code as `test_*.py`).
- Pytest fixtures in `conftest.py` at repo root. Check it before inventing new ones.
- **Mock LLM/API calls** — never hit real services in unit tests. Integration tests are gated behind `INTEGRATION=1`.
- Coverage floor: 70%. Configured in `pyproject.toml`.

## Output format (CI invocations only)

When invoked with `--output-format json --json-schema schemas/finding.schema.json`, return findings as a JSON array. The schema is enforced by tool_use; do not return prose.

For interactive (non-CI) use, prose is fine.

## Working with Claude Code

- Project-scoped slash commands live in `.claude/commands/` (e.g., `/review`). Personal commands stay in `~/.claude/commands/`.
- Skills with `context: fork` run in a sub-agent and don't pollute main context.
- See `.claude/rules/` for path-scoped conventions (`python.md` for `*.py`, `testing.md` for tests, `plugin.md` for plugin layout).

## Jira / GitHub conventions

- Branch names: `PM3-<ticket>-<slug>` (required — CI rejects PRs without a `PM3-N` reference).
- Smart commits: `PM3-12 #in-progress`, `PM3-12 #done`, `PM3-12 #time 2h`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- PR template at `.github/pull_request_template.md` — required Jira link.

## Plan mode vs direct execution (CI policy)

When invoked from CI (`claude -p` in `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml`), use **direct execution**, not plan mode. Reasons:

- The CI invocation is well-scoped by definition — the diff is the work. Reviewing this PR's diff is a single, bounded task.
- Plan mode adds latency and cost without changing the output for a bounded task.
- The structured-output schema (`schemas/finding.schema.json`) already constrains the response shape; plan mode would not improve schema adherence.

Use plan mode (interactively, NOT in CI) when:

- Refactoring across many files where a wrong early decision wastes downstream work.
- Adding a new agent / skill / command that touches multiple plugin layers.
- Investigating an unfamiliar codebase before deciding what to change.

Plan mode for **test generation** (when that workflow lands, PM3-19) may be appropriate when the diff is architectural — generating tests for a new module benefits from upfront planning. Decide per invocation; the default is direct execution unless the diff visibly exceeds 8 files (the same threshold that triggers multi-pass review per the prompt above).
